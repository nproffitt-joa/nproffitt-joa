- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nproffitt-joa
- Iâ€™m working ocasionaly on a project basis for JOA Group as a side hussle.  My skills include programming, networking, systems integration, database, policy, and documentation. I have many years of experience in public sector IT including public safety systems and cloud computing. I'm kind of a snob in Linux, SQL, and backup technologies.
- Iâ€™m currently learning construction management methodologies to help track various projects from small imrovements to larger projects.
